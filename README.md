# A docker Workshop
A todo list project inside a docker environment to learn how docker work

For installation instructions see the *Installation.md* file.
For complete walkthrough, follow the *Explanations.md" file.

This workshop is using
 - Docker & docker-compose *or* Docker Desktop for Windows and MacOS users
 - A bit of Python and Django to see mecanics of Docker
 - A todo list using React, Redux and a database (maybe PostGreSQL .. still to be determined)
 
 ... still must be completed ...
